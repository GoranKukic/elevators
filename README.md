# Elevator App

As part of a internship process I was recently asked to build a basic web application.

This repo is about  what I menaged to build.

## The brief
Build a web app with an elevatory system that:

- has one building,
- building is 10 floors tall,
- building has 3 elevators,
- first elevator is stopping only on odd floors,
- second elevator is stopping only on even floors,
- third elevator is stopping on all flors, but it cant move if fisrt or second elevator is moving,

- elevators has animation for door opening,
- has animation for change floor number on floor picker,
- has sound effect when floor arive on selected floor,
- if first or second elevator is staying 20 socond on some floor, it is going back to the ground level,
- every floor need to have button to call elevator,
